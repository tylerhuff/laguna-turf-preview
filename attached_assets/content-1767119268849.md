# Google Marketing

The best long-term marketing investment for local service businesses

Are potential customers finding your business when they search online? If you’re not showing up on Google’s first page or in the Map Pack, you’re missing out on valuable leads and sales. Here’s how to show up first in Google and why it matters.

When people are actively searching for services—like painters, electricians, home cleaners, or contractors—they’re often ready to **call and book right away.** Showing up at the top means **you’re their first choice for the job.**

Here’s why local visibility matters and how our solutions can help you stay ahead of the competition.

### Why Ranking \#1 Matters

The top organic search result gets **39.8% of clicks**. That’s nearly 4 out of 10 people clicking on the first result they see. If you’re not there, your competitors are getting those clicks.

![Organic SERPS](https://staging44.twentyonesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/663cd08c93c140c7b9145492_eEoCCMvkHLG6MvPSfSdOFXpD7pxnvH3XarhrxmPf-rJY-9Rwo8F6btuIaTGpNEPhUGyxq3-SshP7rVeyTt5Q7th36HdxDzHuDNVvOF4odXiNSbesFLnMlM_NAsU83KB2H364_S0kuZnHSfTCsLI1LWo-1-png.avif)

Businesses in the Google Map Pack receive about **44% of all clicks**. This means almost half of local search traffic goes to the top 3 businesses listed in the Map Pack. If you’re not in the Map Pack, you’re losing potential customers to competitors who are.

![screenshot www.google.com 2022.01.24 12 57 13](https://staging44.twentyonesolutions.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/screenshot-www.google.com-2022.01.24-12_57_13-300x166.avif)

Local searches for services lead to action, showing high intent to hire. When people search for local services, they’re often ready to make a purchase or book a service. Showing up at the top means you’re the first choice for the job.

### How This Impacts Your Business

Ranking higher on Google isn’t just about visibility—it’s about **credibility and trust.** Customers are more likely to click, call, and visit businesses that show up first. If you’re not there, your competitors are. This directly impacts your:

- Lead Generation – More visibility means more people finding your business.
- Sales and Revenue – High-intent customers are more likely to convert.
- Brand Authority – Top-ranking businesses are perceived as more credible and trustworthy.

The good news? Most local businesses aren’t doing this right—which means you have the opportunity to get ahead of your competition if you start now.

### How We Get You to Show up First in Google

#### Local SEO – Get Found Organically and Outrank Competitors

Local SEO helps your business appear at the top of Google search results when customers search for services in your area. If you’re not showing up, they’re finding your competitors instead. Local SEO improves your visibility by:

- Targeting the Exact Keywords Your Customers Are Searching For – We make sure your website matches what people are actively looking for.
- Building Local Authority with High-Quality Backlinks – This boosts your credibility and tells Google you’re the trusted choice in your area.
- Creating Relevant, Localized Content – We publish keyword-rich content that engages your local audience and builds trust.
- Optimizing Your Website for Search Visibility and User Experience – From titles to meta descriptions and internal links, we make sure your site is easy to find and navigate.

Why You Need Local SEO:

- Outrank Local Competitors – If you’re not on the first page, you’re invisible.
- Attract High-Intent Leads – Get found by people ready to buy or book a service.
- Build Long-Term Authority – SEO drives consistent traffic and leads without paying for each click.

Local SEO is a long-term investment that builds your presence and credibility over time. It keeps driving traffic and leads even after the work is done.
