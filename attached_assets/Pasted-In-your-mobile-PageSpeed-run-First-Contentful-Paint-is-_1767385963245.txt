In your mobile PageSpeed run, First Contentful Paint is 8.6s and Largest Contentful Paint is 11.6s, with a big render blocking CSS file, Google Fonts in the critical path, a 454 KB JS bundle, and Lighthouse calling out no text compression plus lots of unused JS.

Do this in order

Make sure you are deploying a real production build as a Static Deployment
If you are serving a Vite dev server or a preview server in production, you will get slow results. Build to dist and deploy that as a static site. Vite is explicit that preview is for local preview, not a production server. 
vitejs

Replit Static Deployments are built for shipping HTML, CSS, and JS files with caching and scaling, and they let you configure response headers. 
Replit Docs

Fix compression and caching at the host layer
Your report literally says no compression applied.

If you are not using Static Deployment, put the app behind a layer that serves Brotli or gzip and long cache headers for assets. Static Deployment is the easiest way to get this right on Replit. 
Replit Docs

Shrink the JS you ship on first load
Lighthouse is flagging reduce unused JavaScript with an estimated 514 KB.

Practical fixes
Only load route code when that route is visited
Lazy load heavy components like the map and any big UI widgets
Remove libraries you are not actually using

Get render blocking CSS and fonts out of the critical path
Your CSS file is blocking render and taking a long time on throttled mobile, and fonts are also in the chain.

Practical fixes
Keep critical CSS tiny, split the rest per route
Self host fonts or at least reduce to the exact weights you need
Use a system font fallback so text paints immediately

Delay Google Maps and analytics until after the page is usable
Google Maps requests show up with short cache TTL, and they are simply not worth paying for in the first render.

Do a static map image first, then load the interactive map only after scroll or click. Same idea for gtag, load it after first paint or when the browser is idle.
