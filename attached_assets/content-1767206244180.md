# Building Premier RV Parks   for America’s Workforce

[Our Strategy](https://ascendequities.com/strategy/)

We are a real estate investment firm that owns, develops, operates, and manages commercial real estate in Texas, Utah, and California.

Our team brings a hands-on approach to our projects- focusing on efficiency, execution, and long-term performance. Since inception, Ascend has developed and operated hundreds of units within the extended-stay RV and multifamily asset classes through joint ventures with institutional capital and limited partner investment.

We manage every phase in-house from site selection, acquisition, to construction, lease-up, and property management. We take pride in doing things the right way for our partners and the communities we invest in.

### **Case Study – Black Gold RV Park**

In early 2024, we took over an RV project in Gardendale/Midland and added 38 brand-new pads with new septic, electric, roads, and landscaping, reactivated 23 existing pads, upgraded utilities and Wi-Fi, refreshed common areas (including pool), and put on-site management in place. We completed the redevelopment in four months. The park reopened as Black Gold RV Park, leased to 100% occupancy with a waitlist within 4 months.

### **Current Development – Greenwood RV**

We’re underway on our next RV park community in Greenwood, Texas, east of Midland. We purchased a 15-acre ranch and will be developing it into 140/pad RV park. The area’s energy-driven growth keeps demand high for RV parks with the amount of transient employment. Most of the RV parks nearby don’t have amenities, making this an ideal spot for a clean, well-managed park with reliable utilities, amenities, and on-site management.

## What Our Investors Say

“I work full time and don’t have time to manage rentals myself. Investing with Ascend has been simple, and communication has been clear. I know what’s going on with the project and feel comfortable with Phil and Patrick at the helm!”

Sarah Armstrong, Slatt Capital

“I’ve now invested in two deals with Ascend, and I plan to do more.”

Josh Campbell, Lions Gate

“This was my second and third private real estate deal, so I had a lot of questions. They’ve made sure this was a process I could get comfortable with. Our RV project with Ascend has gone particularly well, and now I implicitly trust their decision making and have a high degree of confidence in their ability to execute.”

Brendon Gunn, FTG Consulting

“As someone who isn’t in real estate every day, I appreciate how Ascend explains things in plain language. I understand where my money is, what the plan is, and what could impact results. The communication has been consistent and easy to follow.”
