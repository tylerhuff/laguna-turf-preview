## Frequently Asked Questions

**What should my website include?**

A website needs to clearly show what you do, where you do it, and make it easy for a potential customer to reach out. Typically, that includes a home, about, services, portfolio, and contact page with clear call to actions.

**What about marketing?**

We do [Google marketing](https://twentyonesolutions.com/services/search-engine-optimiziation/), or Search Engine Optimization (SEO). SEO is the best long term investment you can make for your business. Once you rank on the top for searches customers use to find services like yours, you stay there. SEO is a long term strategy and because of that we ask for a 12 month commitment.

**Do you own the domain or me?**

You own the domain (and assets). We don’t take hostages. Even if we bought the domain for you, if you cancel with us we transfer the domain for you.

**What’s the turnaround time for a website?**

We can deliver a website preview in 24 hours! A 3-4 page website can deliver within 7 days. If we’re building out more pages or you need extra features, it’ll take a bit longer. Either way, timeline depends on how fast you get back to us with content and approvals.

**How much does a website cost?**

Business [websites](https://twentyonesolutions.com/services/web-design/) are a one time fee with a 30% deposit and the rest due upon website completion. Website hosting and domain is $39/month.

**Will my website be mobile friendly?**

Of course. Every site we build works perfectly on phones, tablets, and desktops.

**Is there a limit to design revisions?**

Nope. We keep refining the design until you’re satisfied.

**Who provides the website content?**

We highly recommend professional photography. If not, we can use professional stock content write copy for you. It’s no additional charge.

**Do you offer ongoing maintenance post-launch?**

Yes. [Maintenance plans](https://twentyonesolutions.com/services/managed-wordpress-hosting/) start at $279/month depending on scope.

**How does the design process work?**

If you like your initial website, great! We will launch it after your edits. If not, we start with a kickoff call and a quick questionnaire. Then we send you three design templates to choose from. Once you pick your favorite, we build the site, send it over for review, make any tweaks you need, and launch. Simple and streamlined.
