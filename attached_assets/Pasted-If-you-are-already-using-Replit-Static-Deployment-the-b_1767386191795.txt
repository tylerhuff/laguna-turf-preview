If you are already using Replit Static Deployment, the biggest wins are about what you ship on first load, and whether the browser can paint before React finishes loading.

Your PageSpeed run shows First Contentful Paint at 8.6 seconds and Largest Contentful Paint at 11.6 seconds on slow mobile. That usually means the browser is waiting on CSS, fonts, and a heavy initial JavaScript bundle before it can show real content.

Do these in this order.

1. Pre render your routes at build time
   This is the number one fix for React sites on static hosting. Generate real HTML for each route during the build so the page can paint immediately, then React hydrates after. You can do this with a build step that crawls your routes and writes out static HTML files into your dist folder.

Why it matters
Without pre rendering, the browser often shows a blank shell until your bundle loads and runs.

2. Stop loading Google Maps on first paint
   Maps is a tax you do not want to pay during the initial render.

What to do
Show a static map image or a simple screenshot placeholder first
Load the interactive map only after the user scrolls to it or clicks it

3. Cut the initial JavaScript bundle with real code splitting
   Lighthouse is flagging lots of unused JavaScript. You want the home route to load only what it needs.

What to do
Lazy load route components
Lazy load big sections like testimonials sliders, accordions, galleries, maps, and any animation libraries
Remove libraries you are not using

4. Fix compression
   Your report indicates no compression applied. That is brutal on slow mobile.

Fastest practical fix with static hosting
Put Cloudflare in front of the site and enable Brotli compression and caching. This usually fixes compression without changing your app code.

5. Fonts and CSS
   If you are using web fonts, keep weights minimal and make sure text can render with a system fallback immediately. Also split any large CSS so you are not blocking paint with styles that are only needed on lower sections or other routes.

If you tell me what router you are using, React Router or something else, and whether you have multiple routes like city pages, I will give you a concrete pre render approach that fits your setup.
