Template Local Service Business Remix Spec

PROMPT START

Role
You are working inside an existing React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind app that is a reusable template for local service businesses. Your job is to remix the current codebase into a polished, generic contractor style website that can be rebranded per client. Do not start from scratch. Refactor and extend what is already there.

Primary goal
Build a fast, conversion focused local service business website that is fully indexable, has strong schema, automated blog content, a working Google Map embed, and a consistent conversion layer on every page.

Inputs you may receive

1. A business details block with some or all fields filled in
2. A link to the existing business website

Critical requirement
If business information is not specified but an existing website link is provided, extract as much as possible from that website and use it to populate the site. Prefer facts over guesses. Do not invent phone numbers, addresses, license numbers, service areas, or review stats.

Extraction rules

1. Prefer facts from the provided website over guesses
2. If a value is not found, leave it blank or use a safe placeholder and keep the UI graceful
3. Create a small local Node script that fetches and parses key pages from the provided website link to extract business data
4. Use a lightweight HTML parser such as cheerio
5. Do not scrape Google

Suggested extraction targets
Home page
Contact page
About page
Services pages
Header and footer content
Any existing schema tags

Section 1

Create a config module at client src config business.ts that exports businessConfig plus sensible defaults for a generic contractor template.

Section 2
Global layout and conversion system

Implement a consistent sitewide layout that wraps every route.

1. Sticky header
2. Primary navigation: Services, Service Areas, About, Contact
3. Primary CTA buttons: Call Now, Get a Quote, Get Estimate
4. Mobile fixed bottom bar with two buttons: Call Now and Get a Quote
5. A persistent CTA footer block above the real footer on every page

CTA behavior
Call Now is a tel link using primaryPhone
Get a Quote opens the quote modal
Get Estimate opens the same modal but uses estimate language in the heading and submit copy

Persistent CTA footer block requirements
Headline and short supporting copy
Primary button Get a Quote
Secondary button Call Now
Compact service area summary or a mini map preview
This block must render on every route, above the real footer

Real footer requirements
Links to Privacy Policy, Terms of Service, Accessibility Statement
Contact info
Service area summary

Section 3
Google Maps integration

Create a reusable BusinessMap component used across the site.

Requirements

1. It must render a working embed with real map output, no placeholders
2. It must be data driven from businessConfig
3. It must not require scraping Google

Priority for map source

1. If mapsShareUrl is provided, use it to produce an embed
2. Else build an embed query using businessName, streetAddress, city, state
3. If a field is missing, fall back to businessName plus city plus state

Use BusinessMap in
Contact page
All location pages
Persistent CTA footer block as a mini map preview or a map toggle
Optional on Home page in the service area section

Section 4
Pages and routing

Use wouter routing.

Required routes
Home
Services index
Service detail pages from businessConfig services by slug
Service Areas page listing cities and neighborhoods
Location pages with dynamic routing
locations city
locations city service
About
Contact
Resources index
Resources detail at resources slug
Thank You page after form submit
Privacy Policy
Terms of Service
Accessibility Statement
Not Found page

All pages must use the shared layout so the persistent CTA footer block and mobile bar appear everywhere.

Section 5
Forms and lead capture

Create a QuoteRequestModal triggered by every Get a Quote and Get Estimate CTA.

Fields
Name
Phone
Service needed dropdown from businessConfig services
Scheduling preference: Today, This week, Flexible
Issue description
Optional photo upload if feasible

Hidden fields
Lead source such as Header CTA, Footer CTA, Mobile Bar, Service Page CTA
Current page path
Selected service slug

Submission
Submit to Formspree using businessConfig formspreeEndpoint.

Contact page
Create a contact form that uses the same submission logic.

Thank You flow
After submit, route to Thank You page. Thank You page repeats the phone number and includes a clear Call Now button.

Section 6
SEO and schema

Create a robust SEO component using a Helmet style head manager.

Every page must set
Title
Description
Canonical
Open Graph tags
Twitter card tags
Robots directives when needed

Implement JSON LD schema generators.

Must support
LocalBusiness schema globally using businessConfig
Service schema on each service page
FAQPage schema on Home and service pages when FAQs exist
BreadcrumbList schema on all non Home pages
AggregateRating schema when aggregate data exists

Meta title patterns
Service page title uses Service Name in City, Business Name when a city context exists
Non city pages use Business Name plus primary service category

Section 7
llms.txt, robots.txt, sitemap.xml

Create public llms.txt generated from businessConfig.

llms.txt must include
Business name
Primary phone
Address
Hours
Full service list
Full service area list
Website URL

robots.txt must point to sitemap.xml.

Generate sitemap.xml automatically.

Sitemap must include
All static routes
All service routes
All location routes generated from config
All resources routes from the blog system

Section 8
Automated blog with SeoBot

Integrate SeoBot.

Pages
Resources index page
Resources detail page

Routing
Posts must render at resources slug.

Build time support
Create a small script that fetches or reads a list of available blog slugs and writes a local JSON file into public so sitemap generation and pre render can include blog routes.

Fallback behavior
If seobotApiKey is not provided, fall back to a small set of local sample posts so routes still work.

Section 9
Static pre render for maximum indexability

Implement or confirm a Puppeteer pre render script at scripts prerender.ts.

It must
Build or use the dist output
Start a local preview server
Visit every route in the same route registry used by sitemap generation
Write static HTML files for each route into dist so each route has an HTML entry point

Routes included in pre render must include
Home
All services
All locations
All resources slugs
Legal pages
Thank You
Not Found

Wire this into the build command so a production build always produces the pre rendered HTML.

Section 10
Performance requirements

1. Lazy load heavy components such as maps and modals, and routes where appropriate, using Suspense
2. Use WebP images and lazy loading with meaningful alt text that includes service and city where appropriate
3. Avoid huge bundles on first paint

Section 11
Design and branding behavior

If branding fields exist in businessConfig, use them to theme the site.

If branding is missing, default to a generic contractor design that looks good
Clean light background
Dark readable text
Strong accent color for CTAs
Professional headings
Simple trust badges
Strong spacing and typography

Do not hardcode TwentyOne Solutions branding. Everything must flow from businessConfig.

Section 12
Remix checklist output

Create a short markdown file at the repo root named REMIX_CHECKLIST.md that tells a user exactly what to change for a new client. It must list
Business config values to update
websiteUrl
formspreeEndpoint
mapsShareUrl or address
Services list
Service areas list
License and insurance fields
seobotApiKey if used

Section 13
Final verification

After implementing, ensure
All routes work in dev
A production build completes
sitemap.xml exists and includes dynamic routes
robots.txt exists
llms.txt exists
Pre rendered HTML files exist in dist for key routes
Forms submit correctly to the Formspree endpoint
Map embed renders a real map without placeholders
Legal pages are accessible from the footer
Persistent CTA footer block appears on every page above the real footer

PROMPT END
