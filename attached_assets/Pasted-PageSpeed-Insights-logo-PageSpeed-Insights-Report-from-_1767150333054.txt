Preconnected origins
preconnect hints help the browser establish a connection earlier in the page load, saving time when the first request for that origin is made. The following are the origins that the page preconnected to.
no origins were preconnected
Preconnect candidates
Add preconnect hints to your most important origins, but try to use no more than 4.
No additional origins are good candidates for preconnecting

Accessibility
These checks highlight opportunities to improve the accessibility of your web app. Automatic detection can only detect a subset of issues and does not guarantee the accessibility of your web app, so manual testing is also encouraged.
Names and labels
Buttons do not have an accessible name
These are opportunities to improve the semantics of the controls in your application. This may enhance the experience for users of assistive technology, like a screen reader.
Best practices
[user-scalable="no"] is used in the <meta name="viewport"> element or the [maximum-scale] attribute is less than 5.
Touch targets do not have sufficient size or spacing.
Document does not have a main landmark.
Identical links have the same purpose.
These items highlight common accessibility best practices.
Contrast
Background and foreground colors do not have a sufficient contrast ratio.
These are opportunities to improve the legibility of your content.
Navigation
Heading elements are not in a sequentially-descending order
These are opportunities to improve keyboard navigation in your application.
